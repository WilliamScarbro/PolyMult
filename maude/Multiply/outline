Framework for applying arbitrary reductions to multiply operator on quotient ring

EQ-LANG:
  operator
  type
  function
  reduction
Reduction Search (obj)
  operator (obj)
  reduction (obj)
  rule (obj)
  reduce( operator , rule ) -> reduction(list) <- action
QR:
  multiply (operator)
  add (operator)
  qr (type)
FFT:
  fft (function)
  other fft flavors
  fft-reduction (reduction)




TODO

add more reductions (review berstein reductions)
add compilation (provide definition for phi)

can we view spiral fft (two recursive calls in one) as a reduction of the fft function?
