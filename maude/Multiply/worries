Things i am worried about


# What does the end language look like?
  how do we extend to other reductions algorithms
    domain vs reducible descriptions
solution:
  meta maude may solve language interface
  compilation path from reducible to domain

# Is there any advantage to using obj language to search reductions
  cons: 
    rule applications are already cached by maude
    a lot more machinery
    strategies are supported by maude
  pros:
    strategy language may not be complex enough to do optimization
    makes code reuse more clear

# how do we handle constants?
  possible: search and replace
  depends on final language

# can we reduce FFT ?
  specifically: can we use FFT subcalls at sinlge FFT level (like spiral)
